    /* TODO: complete getMenuItems so that it returns a nested menu structure from the database
    Requirements
    - the eloquent expressions should result in EXACTLY one SQL query no matter the nesting level or the amount of menu items.
    - post process your results in PHP
    - it should work for infinite level of depth (children of childrens children of childrens children, ...)
    - verify your solution with `php artisan test`
    - do a `git commit && git push` after you are done or when the time limit is over

    Hints:
    - imagine a maximum of a few hundred menu items
    - partial or not working answers also get graded so make sure you commit what you have
